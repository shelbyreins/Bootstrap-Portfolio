# Bootstrap-Portfolio

## Introduction

I built a portfolio for future projects. I will add projects in as the course continues.

## Technologies Used
- Bootstrap
- CSS
- Git
- Github

## Summary

I built a responsive portfolio using documentation from Bootstrap. There are three sections to the portfolio inlcuding an About Me, Portfolio, and Contact page. All pages are easily accessible through the navagation bar. In order to get the correct colors, fonts, and borders I added a CSS page.
